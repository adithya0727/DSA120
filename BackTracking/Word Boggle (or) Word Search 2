/* Approach:                [PATTERN : SAME AS RAT IN A MAZE-1 || WORD SEARCH-1]
Given a dictionary of distinct words and an M x N board where every cell has one character. Find all possible words from the dictionary that can be formed by a sequence of adjacent characters on the board.
We can move to any of 8 adjacent characters
Note: While forming a word we can move to any of the 8 adjacent cells. A cell can be used only once in one word.
Input: 
N = 1
dictionary = {"CAT"}
R = 3, C = 3   //numbers
board = {{C,A,P},{A,N,D},{T,I,E}}
Output:
CAT
Explanation: 
C A P
A N D
T I E            [ADITYA VERMA APPROACH]
1) INTUITION : We consider each Character [cell in the 2D vector] as a STARTING CHARACTER TO FIND ALL THE WORDS THAT WE CAN BUILD WITH THAT CHARACTER : If at any instance
it matches with any of the words in the dictionary we store it in our result vector.
BREAKDOWN : 
a) Firstly , we run a for loop to check the dfs for each and every element/cell to check for occurances of words , For each element:
b) we need the visited array to keep track of all the vistied elements to avoid re-visiting : and we keep appending the characters to the str until there are no
more elements left in the matrix , we also compare with the dict at each instance to see if we find any words. [BASE CASE]
c) for loop : We have the option to move in 8 DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS : so we make two arrays in such a way that they act as pairs , they are the co-ordinates on
how i and j will move when the user goes in either of the 8 directions 
we check for 2 validations like rat in a maze :
out-of-bounds , visited or not.
d) We create the new co-ordinate values and controlled recursion is applied only when the conditions are true.
e) BackTracking : we make the position unvisited again and remove the last element in the string.
time -  O(ROW*COL*N*W) : row*col : outer loop , for each cell we used nested for loops and within these nested for loops : (N*W) => w-avg length of all words we 
generate times the N-number of words in the dictionary we check for each recursive call.
space - O(ROW*COL + K*X) : visited array + result(K-avg length of words , X-Total number of words).

2)  [OPTIMISED APPROACH]:
INTUITION : Instead of using a for loop , we just use recursive calls , it does increase the stack space but it's more efficient , i don't know how to perform
pruning in the above method , but using this we only traverse through the right path till the length of the word. We perform pruning and save a lot of time by 
ignoring a lot of unnessasary branches : For each cell where the first index is matching : we check in 8 different directions if the given word is found.
time - O(N*ROW*COL*8^L) : (ROW*COL) : we might to traverse through whole matrix , (8^L) : till the length of the word matches , since we are choosing only the right
path , for each index we have 8 different directions we can move in.
space - O(ROW*COL + N*X) : (recursion stack at the max might take row*col stack space) , to store our answer in a string vector : N-number of words in dictionary
in worst case if all words are present and X- avg length of each word.
