/* Approach:
Basically , array has infinite elements and we have to apply BS and find the index of key.
1) Problem : We can't assign END properly as it is infinite , to solve this : 
firstly, start=0,end=1 , we compare if end < key , then we double it until condition goes false and then oncw we get a VALID range : we can apply BS.
*/

1) algo:
while(arr[end] <= key){
    start = end;          //start is updated to END : since if key is lesser than the current END Value : clearly start should be our new range to find KEY.
    end = end*2;         // Increase by 2 positions each time till condition fails
}

binarysearch(arr,start,end,key);
