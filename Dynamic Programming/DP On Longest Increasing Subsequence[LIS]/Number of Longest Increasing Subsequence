/*Approach:        [PATTERN : Length of LIS : 5TH Approach]
Given an integer array arr, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.
Notice that the sequence has to be strictly increasing.

1) Tabulation : Use a count array to hold and add up all possibilities and then return the count of the index which has the maximum LIS.
TC : O(N^2 + N)  SC : O(N)
