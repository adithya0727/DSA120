/* Approach :
1) using fast and slow pointer method : slow ptr moves at a single pace while fast moves twice faster : as soon as twice reaches the end , its clear that the slow ptr is exactly in the Middle.
learnings : start fast with head->next : because we might iterate one step further in the case when its even.

1) Node* insertInMiddle(Node* head, int x) {
  Node* slow = head;
  Node* fast = head->next;
  Node* ele = new Node(x);
    
  while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
    slow = slow->next;
    fast = fast->next->next;
  }

  ele->next = slow->next;
  slow->next = ele;

  return head;
