/* Approach:
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
1) Naive Approach : find the overall LENGTH of the LL - Nth position (given) + 1 : run a for loop till the position and then just attach prev to the temp->next and 
delete it to avoid memory leakage.
2) INTUITION : move the fast pointer n times ahead of the slow pointer. then start moving both of them at a single pace till fast->next == NULL.
now visualise this : both pointers have a gap of n : once fast reaches the end : clearly slow is N TIMES BEHIND FAST : WHICH IS EXACTLY THE POINT WHERE THE NODE WE
WANT TO DELETE EXISTS.
we stop one step ahead , so that we can unlink using prev to next->next.
