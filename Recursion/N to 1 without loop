/* Approach :
i/p : 3
o/p : 3 2 1 
we start iterating from N : we call the function recursively and store the value of the recursive function in a vector which is the return type of the function.
and go on till we hit 0. [ASCENDING]
once the base condition hits -> we start popping and performing the insert operation and then pop() store the next function call in v and insert and so on.
[DESCENDING]
learning : we can use v.insert to insert elements in the position that we desire as the problem demands.
