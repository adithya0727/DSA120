/* Approaches :
1) using the .erase(str.begin()+i) method and decrementing i-- each time the condition comes true inside a Loop.
2) using a loop , by using vectors and push_back() to push each element except when its a white space.
3) using the replace method which comes in-built in cpp. which is like replace(str.begin(),str.end(),' ',{}).
