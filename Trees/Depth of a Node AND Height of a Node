/* Aprroach:

1) Depth of a Node : Number of edges from the root node till the mentioned node.
           1
          / \
         2   3
        / \ / \
       4  5 6  7
Depth of a tree for the node 6 here would be : 2 (number of edges from root to 6 : 1-3-6).
first condition : base case : return -1 if node==NUll , dist is initialised with -1 (it acts as a placeholder as a negative integer)
second step : if condition : firstly check root->data and then recursively traverse left and right subtree until the find the element we are looking for.
third step (element FOUND & THUS stack UNWINDING) : once the required element is found => root->data will be true. Once that happens : if statement will become true
Once if statement becomes TRUE , we started adding +1 each time to dist and after every stack unwind after one success : all if statements start becoming TRUE 
and we keep adding 1 until the root finally unwinds. 
We start with dist=-1 because the we want the number of edges NOT the number of nodes.
Time and Space : O(N).

2) Height of a Node : Number of edges from the given node till the FARTHEST LEAF NODE is the height of that node.
Same function as the height of a tree , but only one change , we have the paramter Height which is passed by reference. It is updated only when the node->val == key.
and normal height stack unwinding happens. Post function , we return the height variable which is now changed.
We start with -1 as we need the maximum no. of edges and not nodes.
Time and Space : O(N).
