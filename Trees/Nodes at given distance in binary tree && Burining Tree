/* Approach:    [Refer book for better visualization]
1) Given a binary tree, a target node in the binary tree, and an integer value k, find all the nodes that are at distance k from the given target node. No parent pointers are available.
Note:
You have to return the list in sorted order. The tree will not contain duplicate values.
KEY POINTS : 1) Number of Edges is EQUAL TO K : so at level 1 : we have all nodes that are 1 EDGE AWAY FROM THE TARGET NODE AND SO ON...
2) With each step , COUNT : we aremoving one step/edge away from the target node in all directions that possibly exist. (parent,left,right).
Input:      
          20
        /    \
      8       22 
    /   \
   4    12 
       /   \
      10    14
Target Node = 8
K = 2
Output: 10 14 22
Explanation: The three nodes at distance 2
from node 8 are 10, 14, 22.
1) Visualization : to find all nodes that are at a distance k from a given node , we will make so that Each edge is considered as one distance away from the target node.
So visualise a Circle for each node : level 1 circle will be its adjacent left , right and parent node , level 2 circle will be bigger with direction of 2 edges gap
between left , right and parent. and so on for 3 and 4.
Two ISSUES : 1) left and right we can move , but the parent node we can't keep track of : so we use a map to store the node-parent relationship.
MAP
key=>Node*(children) || value=>Parent   //by doing BFS , now can go back to reach a particular node's parent too
     8                       20
     22                      20
     4                       8
     12                      8
     10                      12
     14                      12
2) We don't want to be traversing the same repeated Nodes. if a particular node has been traversed once already , we ignore and move forward for that we use a 
VISITED map , to store nodes with bool values so that we don't repeat it again.
Usually the parent node,left,right will already be considered once , so that will be repeated and we want to avoid that.
Problem Breakdown : 
a) Firstly we'll map the children with thier respective parents as mentioned above and also we need to traget as Node* and not int , since we need to traverse from there.
b) Next , we perform another BFS , where we start from the target node and a COUNT , which is used to keep track for each level / the count of edges around the target we are searching for.
c) at count=0 , we just have root and we set that as visited firstly , [READ KEY POINTS ABOVE] => then at level 1 : we have all nodes that are 1 edge away from the target
, at level 2: we have all nodes in all directions that are two EDGES away from the TARGET node.
d) after inserting root , we check the size of queue , based on that the WHOLE LEVEL (level 1 : 4,12,20 : 8) , each node : left,right,parent are traversed and pushed
based on visits and availability and we increment to the next level.
e) We will keep moving till the count==k , then we break. so right now in the queue : we have all the Nodes that a K EDGES away from the target node , we just insert into a vector
f) Sort the vector and Return it.
time = O(N*logN) : sorting space : O(N)
