/* Approach:
Question : print the path from the root Node to A particular given node(x).
No node has same values and the x value is definitely present in the tree.
1) basically we can perform any dfs traversal , as we HIT the required node : in our recusrive stack we actually have the path right there.
we perform push and pop operations on vector.
we insert value initially , check for val==x , if yes we start backtracking with return the current vector , if NO : we move both left and right until we hit it.
we will come across many paths LEAF node , if that happens : we pop_back() last element as we backtrack each time from that path and start traversing a new path.

1) bool getPath(node * root, vector < int > & arr, int x) {
  // if root is NULL
  // there is no path
  if (!root)
    return false;

  // push the node's value in 'arr'
  arr.push_back(root -> data);

  // if it is the required node
  // return true
  if (root -> data == x)
    return true;

  // else check whether the required node lies
  // in the left subtree or right subtree of
  // the current node
  if (getPath(root -> left, arr, x) ||
    getPath(root -> right, arr, x))
    return true;

  // required node does not lie either in the
  // left or right subtree of the current node
  // Thus, remove current node's value from
  // 'arr'and then return false  as we backtrack to the previous node to find an alternative path to search for.
  arr.pop_back();
  return false;
