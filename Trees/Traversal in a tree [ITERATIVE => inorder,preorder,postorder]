Lets know recursive approach : left - mid - right is the order to print (4,2,5,1,3). 
algo : 1) func(root->left) 2) cout<<root->val 3) func(root->right) . Now lets relate it to iterative.
1) In-order : Using Stack : we start with moving towards the left subtree till it reaches null. (like step 1)
then we print root->val (like step 2) and then we move to the right element and start checking for left first , print and right again and the process repeats itself.
Pattern is very similar : we store the elements in stack , like stack unwinding : we pop the top element and return to the previous node and again print and perform right.
It is the same as recursion literally. time and space : O(N).

2) Pre-order : Only one variation in the code : the print statement is called within the second while loop itself as for each subtree the order of printing would be
mid -> left -> right : so it would make sense to print the mid element for each subtree first , move towards the left and then print the left ones and finally move towards
the right and follow so.  time and space : O(N).

3) Post-order : 
time and space : O(N).
